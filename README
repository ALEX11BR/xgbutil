This is a utility library designed to work with the X Go Binding. This 
project's main goal is to make various X related tasks easier. For example, 
binding keys, using the EWMH or ICCCM specs with the window manager, 
moving/resizing windows, assigning function callbacks to particular events, 
etc.

Much of the functionality found in this package is a very close port to my
other project, xpybutil.

To install:

  go get burntsushi.net/go/xgbutil
